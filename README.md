# Running this Project       
Clone the repositiory on your machine and run:

```bash
pnpm i
```

to install the required dependencies, 
after that you can run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will serve the app on [this url](http://localhost:5173)  which would be enough to start downloading mp3 from Youtube links.
